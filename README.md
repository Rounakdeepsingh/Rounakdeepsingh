## 🚀 Core Focus & Philosophy

My current work centers on a disciplined approach to problem-solving and continuous learning.

* 🧠 **Mastering DSA:** Actively building a **[1,000+ problem algorithms notebook](https://github.com/Rounakdeepsingh/algorithms-playbook)**, complete with topic-wise solutions and reusable templates.
* 🔐 **Exploring Systems & Security:** Hands-on exploration of how systems scale, break, and can be defended.
* 📚 **Sharing Knowledge:** Publishing solution writeups and post-contest debriefs to solidify understanding.

* 💞️ **Open to collaborating on:** Backend, security, and algorithmic projects.
* 📫 **Connect with me:** **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rounakdeep-singh/)**
